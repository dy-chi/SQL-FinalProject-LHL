# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Getting to know the data,
 -   what is each column likely to represent,
 -   in what context was the data likely collected
Cleaning Data
 - Where is data missing, and where is complete
 -   finding the most important columns which do not have missing data or hard to handle values
 -   filling in empty columns, where appropriate 
 - Finding duplicates
 -   find duplicates within tables and between tables
 - Data Conversion. Convert important columns to approriate datatypes to save time when querying and increase performace
 - Creating new tables with unique identifiers similar to the northwinds demo data set

## Challenges 
I found the documentation process difficult as in pressing forward and answering questions, I would notice something i missed in the cleaning step and have to return to that process. It was also intimi
